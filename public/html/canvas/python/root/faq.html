            <p>
                Probably not. I have both the first and second editions. Both are good. The newer edition
                does have some updated content. In fact, programming languages do evolve over time, so
                there will be ongoing changes to the language. We will talk through the changes and discover
                other resources to use as well.</p>
            <p>
                Relative to other textbooks, this one is modestly priced, but you can probably find a used
                copy of the older edition and save some a few dollars. Be aware that buying used books
                online can take longer to arrive and the delay may not be worth the savings.</p>
            <p>
                The newer version is the one supported by the publisher and any updated materials.

            <p>Yes! Actually, a stable Linux release would probably be ok too.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Really, either is fine, as long as you are comfortable using the system you choose.</p>
            <p>
                I actually get this question a lot. It is recommended that you have a reliable
                computer which runs <em>satisfactorily</em> with the latest updates and security patches
                installed.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will be using Python3, which has compatible releases for recent Windows, and
                Linux-based (including macos) computers. I regularly use both macos and windows (11)
                for development, test, and demonstration. The choice is up to you. It is expected
                that you are comfortable using whichever computer system that you choose.
            </p>

                If your computer is <em>too old</em> or <em>too slow</em> by your own assessment,
                then you might want to consider upgrading to a newer machine of finding another to
                use for this class.

                purchasing a new PC. The college also may have computer resources to loan for student use.

            <p>maybe. probably.</p>

            <p>Things happen. I'm pretty reasonable, but don't take advantage of me.</p>

        <div id="hyflex" style="list-style: none; display: none; margin: 20px;">
            <p>kinda.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>I do not grade on attendance.</p>
            <p>
                Class meetings are scheduled to help students better understand the curriculum
                and to help the instructor more effectively communicate ideas to students.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe class participation is beneficial. I think that through our conversations,
                I can better assess how material is being received and understood. With feedback we
                can speed up and slow down through different topics within schedule boundaries.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are very good reasons for students electing to participate from a remote
                location. The HyFlex classroom is designed to support those students, but there
                is still an expectation that the student is responsible for hosting a suitable
                remote classroom environment, with adequate technical resources and as free from
                distractions as possible.
