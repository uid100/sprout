<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>As I mentioned, programming classes usually start out with very simple exercises to bridge the human-machine
    interface as quickly as possible. In other words, students provide simple instructions to get the computer to do
    something. If you continue with studying other programming languages, you'll find that this is usually a special
    program called "HelloWorld." This is true in almost every language I've ever seen, with minor variations and few
    exceptions. A quick search will reveal many of these.</p>
<p>In addition to simply getting started, another theme that I hope you saw was the realization that almost every
    program you'll ever write or use follows the same pattern:</p>
<ul>
    <li>it takes some sort of<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>input</strong>,</li>
    <li>does some amount of<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>processing</strong>,</li>
    <li>and responds with some<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>output</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>That can mean prompting the user for two numbers, multiplying them together, and displaying the result, or it can be
    waiting for a pedestrian to press a button, monitoring the traffic status, and cycling a traffic light to signal
    cross traffic to slow, then stop, and then lighting a Walk signal and starting a timer to trigger the next cycle.
    Think about any computer application that you use. Can you identify the inputs and the outputs?</p>
<p>This week you did this. You wrote usable and useful computer programs. You taught the computer how to respond to
    inputs and deliver a predictable result. That's quite an accomplishment. This class and your experiences will get
    more complex, but we'll build on this one step at a time.</p>

<h2>Pseudocode</h2>
<p><span><i>What is it?</i></span></p>
<p>In one of my advanced programming classes, I bring decks of playing cards to class and deal them to my students and I
    ask them to sort that set of cards in their hand. This is something that is fundamental to anyone who has ever
    played just about any card game. Next I ask them to each write down a set of instructions of how to sort a hand of
    cards and then trade those instructions with each other and try and follow the steps, explicitly. Every single step
    on the instructions needs to be followed, exactly as written. Yes, there are assumptions and questions and rules.
    What does it mean to "sort" them? Why is a 'Q' higher than a 'J'? Does sort mean left-to-right? .. low-to-high? ..
    is the 'Ace' the highest card or the lowest? What about suits (hearts, diamonds...)? Oh, and I have 'Jokers' in my
    card decks because my family uses them for some games. Some of the students will find them in their hand and choose
    how to deal with them in their instructions, but some might find them in their hand and not have any instructions
    written for them by another student who didn't think that they'd be there.</p>
<p>This brings up very real situations and common problems we run into when writing code. There are circumstances that
    might be encountered that the developer needs to consider. We'd like to think that the user will enter values the
    way we expect them to, but most errors in code exist because a user enters something that we didn't imagine. An
    application might ask for a user's birthday. Did the developer check to see that 31-April is not a valid date, and
    that although it's uncommon to be born on 29-Feb, it is not uncommon for babies to be born on 29-Feb.</p>
<p>But more importantly, is that sequence of instructions clear enough to follow? Is it complete and detailed? Is the
    sequence correct and not ambiguous? In other words is there one and only one way to follow them and get the correct
    result. If these things are all done correctly, then anyone you give those instructions will be able to follow them
    and get the same result, every time.</p>
<p>What are all of the steps to do something? What is the correct order of all of those steps?</p>
<p>Pseudocode is that set of clear instructions that you can give to anyone and they could follow them to get the same
    result.</p>
<p><span><i>What isn't it?</i></span></p>
<p>Pseudocode is not written in any programming language. In fact, the logic should be simple enough that you could give
    these instructions to someone who has no programming knowledge at all and follow them. The pseudocode also should
    make no assumptions of what language will be used to write the solution.</p>
<p>This <em>sequence</em> of <em>logical instructions</em>, which is commonly called an <em>algorithm</em> could be read
    by any programmer and they might decide which programming language best fits the solution, but that choice of
    language would make no difference to the algorithm that was written in pseudocode.</p>
<p>For our labs, do not write the solution in Python and then copy your code into a text file and call it 'pseudocode.'
    If everything in your set of simple, logical, sequenced instructions aren't completely clear to your roommate, or
    your great aunt Helen, or your son's basketball coach, then you might be missing something.</p>
<p>Keep it simple, logical, correct.</p>
<p class="ic-flash-info"><strong>Do not submit a copy of your code and call it pseudocode.</strong></p>

<h2><i>Shebang!</i></h2>
<p>Yes, that's really what it's called.</p>
<p>The '#' symbol has been called many things over the years, but most recently, in the computer world at least, it's
    been referred to as a 'hash' symbol. Instagram uses them to identify keywords. They call these 'hashtags' which is a
    <em>tag</em> (identifier) set off by a <em>hash</em> symbol.</p>
<p>The exclamation point ('!'), used in written languages, is used for other purposes in programming and is often
    pronounced as 'bang.'</p>
<p>Together the hash-bang has become known as a 'shebang' (pronounced: shuh-BANG) and is used in scripting or
    interpreted languages. This line needs to be at the very beginning of a file. The hash (#) tells the interpreter to
    ignore or do nothing with this line, but it tells most operating systems which interpreter to use. In the case of
    Python3, the common usage is "#!/usr/bin/env python3"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>(Examples)</h3>
<p>"#!/usr/bin/env bash" tells the shell reading this file to use the Bash shell to execute the file.</p>
<p>"#!/usr/bin/env pwsh" is sometimes used with Windows Powershell scripts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Writing good code</h2>
<h3>Self-documenting code</h3>
<p>Yes, good code needs to work, but like pseudocode, it should be clear and simple to follow. It might be somebody else
    that has to update or fix or reuse something that you've written, but just as commonly, it could be you (or me!)
    that has to open a program that we've written months or years before and we have to sort through it and try and
    remember what we were thinking at the time.</p>
<p>Good code starts with good identifiers. Give your variables logical names. A variable called "height" or
    "height_in_inches" or "centimeters" or even "cm" is pretty clear what kind of data it might contain. If your
    variables have clear, logical names, then the purpose of a statement such
    as<br /><code>area_of_circle = value_of_pi * Radius * Radius</code><br />would be very clear, and good clear code is
    less likely to have errors.</p>
<h3>Using Comments</h3>
<p>Self-documented code is always a good idea, but sometimes, even with good name choices for variables and functions
    (or methods), comments are still helpful to keep the developers intent clear.</p>
<p><code>tax_rate = 0.0825 # local tax rate for El Cajon as of 1-Aug-2021</code></p>
<p>This line not only defines the value in one place, making it easy to update and use, but it also clarifies where that
    value originated.</p>
<p><code>X = 4 * sqrt(1-(a*a))</code><br />is also a very logical expression and one that might be in common use in
    statistical analysis, but without comments and better descriptions, its purpose is not clear to anyone.</p>

<h3 style="font-style: italic;">Help, I'm lost and sinking!</h3>
<p>First of all, that's probably a mixed metaphor. Hahaha! Just kidding.</p>
<p>I'm here to help. I know you can't see me, but I'm pretty accessible. Have you visited the Discord server yet?
    There's a channel just for this class!</p>
<p>Visit me on Wednesday afternoon. Connect just to say hello or ask a question. I welcome the chance to meet online
    students.</p>
<p><em>(Really!)</em> Lots of good stuff gets posted on the Discord server. Don't forget to check in there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="font-style: italic;">Ok, I'm not lost but I tripped a couple times at the start.</h3>
<p>If you missed the first lab or first exam, do them now! Life happens. We are all juggling far more things than
    homework. Things happen and have to be prioritized. Please get your homework done on time. It makes my life much
    easier and makes me happier. But when things happen, I'd still rather have you do the assignment than have you skip
    it, just because it's late. If it is late, I may take some points off. If it happens a lot, I may not be able to
    grade things that are really late, but I will try. I'm very forgiving and understanding with grades until late
    becomes a pattern. when in doubt, do the assignment. If a crisis gets in the way, let me know. I'm human too. If the
    assignment is locked in Canvas, then you'll need to ask me directly (office hours!) if you can submit it.</p>
<h3 style="font-style: italic;">I did the assignment but didn't get all the points I expected</h3>
<p>Let's check it again. Maybe you didn't hand it all the files you meant to. I'll usually only look at the last version
    that you submit before the due date. If you made a mistake and caught it, resubmit and I'll look at the last one.
</p>
<p>Be sure and read ALL of the instructions. Don't stop reading at the first page, there might be more to do. The Rubric
    will always tell you where the points are hiding.</p>
<p>I make mistakes too. If I included a comment that makes no sense, let me know. Sometimes I grade homework very late
    at night. If I make a mistake while grading something, I will apologize, thank you for bringing to my attention, and
    fix it.</p>
