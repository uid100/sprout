<p>So, I made an error this evening in class. The calendar does not have 2 weeks to complete this lab, just one.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Next week will start a two week lab, but the content from this week is essential for completing next. All the more
    reason not to delay getting this one started!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the good news... tonight we did discuss (at length!):</p>
<ul>
    <li>how to define a method</li>
    <li>how to call a method that has been defined</li>
    <li>how to pass a value to a parameter for use inside the method</li>
    <li>how to return a value (result) from a method</li>
</ul>
<p>We also explained the meaning of variable <em>scope </em>and that variables only exist within the block of code where
    it was declared. And in Python, a local block of code is identified by the indentation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You also saw that you can call methods from another library, or module.&nbsp; There are methods in the standard
    Python library that you already know, like <strong>int()</strong> and <strong>str()</strong> and<strong>
        print()</strong> and<strong> input()</strong>, and there are methods that you have called after importing other
    libraries, like you did when you imported the <strong>random</strong> module and then made a call to
    <strong>random.next().</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>Notice that methods <em>always</em> have parentheses, and sometimes values can be included in the parentheses to pass
    the value to a method's parameter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this week's lab, you will write a module called "Methods.py" and you will add methods to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be sure to keep all of your files in the same folder, since multiple exercises will be importing your Methods.py
    module and making calls to your methods. Don't make copies of this file. Keep it as a single file.</p>
<p>Also, all of your files should be in your lab folder, don't include subfolders for these exercises.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I created a video walk-through for Lab6 exercise 1, the guided exercise, and it may be helpful.</p>

<p>See you next week!</p>
