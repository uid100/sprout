<p>Hello again!</p>
<h3>Another week of coding!</h3>
<p>I know you've heard me say it before. I really do like writing code. I enjoy the challenge, I enjoy the satisfaction
    <em>when it's done!</em></p>
<p>Of course <em>done</em> can be subjective too. When you write code, usually you start with the framework. Get
    something running first then satisfy frequirements until they are all met. But even then, the code should be
    revisited to optimize and clarify things. Look it over and decide what could be written better.</p>
<p>And testing! Always test while you're writing your code. There may be more testing later, but the code should be
    pretty thorougly tested before it reaches 'formal' testing.</p>
<h3>Details</h3>
<p>Last week I talked about the interpreter directive (<em>shebang!</em>) and also about planning and design documents,
    especially pseudocode. I know many of you understood and followed that in your assignments, but rather than repeat
    that here, I will suggest that some of you go back and read the last announcement again.</p>
<h3>Conditions and Decisions</h3>
<p>This week we jump into conditional statements. If, Else if, Else are common in programming as they are in your
    everyday experience. There are some syntax details to follow and practics, but the logic should be simple if you
    don't overthink it.</p>
