<h2 class="alert alert-info">Week 4</h2>
<p><strong>Hello!</strong></p>
<p>Last week, and this, we are moving through some fundamental concepts in programming, Conditional statements, and
    Loops!</p>
<p>Following variables, these two concepts are foundational to any discussion or understanding of programming. We will
    spend one week on each of the concepts, but make sure you take the time to really understand them. Follow along with
    the book demonstrations and the lab exercises.</p>
<p>I do appreciate the participation from both the classroom attendees and those online / remote learners. Lots of good
    questions! I know this is a lot of material, but all of us are relying only each of you to set the pace.</p>
<p>If you have a question, chances are someone else does too!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="alert alert-info">Questions?</h3>
<h4>Office Hours</h4>
<p>Thanks to those of you who have visited my office hours. I enjoy discussing the labs and technical questions that you
    have. This is an optional discussion. There is not a planned lesson or lecture, but usually the discussions are
    generally or directly related to the current or a recent lab. If more than one student joins in, I encourage you to
    try and answer each other's questions first. Many times, someone else has just worked through the same things and
    ran into the same challenges.</p>
<p>There were probably more people connecting to Office Hours when this class was 100% online.</p>
<p>This is optional. If a student doesn't want or need to log in, that's ok. This is your class. I'm here to help!</p>
<p>If you are not able to make it to the scheduled time on Wednesday afternoon, let me know and I can try and schedule
    another time to meet. Some weeks will be easier than others.</p>
<p>The first couple of weeks of the semester, I always have a few students adding and dropping the course or have other
    administrative "stuff" that needs attention. By now that should be stabilized and the office hours discussions are
    generally more technical and directly applicable to the lab assignments and less administrative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="alert alert-info">Grading</h3>
<p>I'm encouraged by the good work that most of you are doing, and I generally try to have the labs graded within a few
    days of when they are due. I do have a few students that have contacted me and arranged to submit assignments a
    little late due to circumstances beyond their control. Those are on my todo list also, but I can't always get to
    them right away, so please be patient.</p>
<p>I generally do take significant time to grade your assignments and provide constructive feedback which I hope that
    you find helpful, in some cases, I may look at an assignment, and see a lot of missing or misguided work, and have
    emailed students directly to invite them to make corrections before I grade them.</p>
<p>If I've graded an assignment and then walked through line-by-line corrections and you resubmit it, I may look at it
    if I have time, but that isn't a promise that I will re-grade multiple submissions. I just can't promise that amount
    of time. My priority focus is grading the current assignments submitted on-time. Drop me a line if you have
    questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="alert alert-info">Loops</h2>
<p>This week's assignments are all about loops, and the chapter will contain more information about this. In
    programming, there are a few common types but primarily <strong>For</strong> loops and <strong>While</strong> loops.
    These are common logic structures in coding and in daily logic.</p>
<h3>For Loops</h3>
<p>For Loops cycle through a known number of iterations such as checking each pair of socks in a drawer for holes, or
    grading 12 homework assignments. For each of the items, complete the task or list of tasks, and then continue with
    the next one.</p>
<h3>While Loops</h3>
<p>The logic for <strong>While</strong> loop is a little different. Check a condition and keep going until the condition
    is met.</p>
<p>To illustrate the difference, imagine a workday. Given an eight hour shift, <strong>For</strong> each hour, do all of
    the things that need to happen and then go home, in contrast, imagine a deadline that has to be met.
    <strong>While</strong> there is still work to be done, keep working! These are very similar, in that in both of
    these examples, there may be repetitive work and at the end of each cycle or iteration or loop, something gets
    checked.
</p>
<p>In the case of the <strong>For</strong> loop, we check to see if there is another in the sequence, with the
    <strong>While</strong> loop we check to see if the exit criteria (is it done?) is met.
</p>
<p>There are two more concepts associated with loops that are often considered, <em>nested loops</em>, and
    <em>infinite</em> loops.
</p>
<h4>Nested Loops</h4>
<p>With <em>nested loops</em>, within a loop, there may be another (and another!), such as look in each file of each
    file drawer of each file cabinet. In Python, each nested loop gets indented to it's own column. Be careful of this!
</p>
<h4>Infinite (or endless) Loops</h4>
<p><em>Infinite loops</em> may occur accidentally and exist as a bug in programming code. Perhaps a variable is set to
    the wrong value within a loop or not cycled to the next value to progress through the loop. These are common errors
    and the developer should be careful to watch these. However, <em>Infinite loops</em> are <strong>not</strong> always
    errors. There are a lot of times when an infinite loop can be very useful. Consider a traffic control system. It
    will check to see if a pedestrian, or a vehicle is waiting and then cycle the traffic lights, and then check again.
    Or a medical life support system. It continues to operate until it is turned off, it doesn't stop after 100 cycles!
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Coding is fun!</strong></p>
<p>Like playing a game, it requires using sometimes creative ideas to try and complete a challenging objective.</p>
<p>Coding is sometimes frustrating, but when I work on a challenge, and I successfully complete it by applying a
    creative approach, it gives me a sense of accomplishment and joy. Sometimes that means more than an 8-5 kind of
    workday.</p>
<p>I don't write code because it's easy. I do it because enjoy it!</p>
