<p>Entities, things, stuff, objects.. this thing, that thing...&nbsp;</p>
<p>Considerations of object-oriented programming starts with the objects.&nbsp; Identify the entities first, then
    describe them by their features and behaviors. Focus on the&nbsp;<em>thing</em> first, the syntax will follow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lab exercises in this course are relatively simple (not complex). Example code, followed by a chance to practice
    and apply the same concept in a (sometimes) different way. In most cases, there is a more complex problem statement.
    In these cases, it's usually best practice to identify what the entities are first, and how they interact. This
    makes the code easier to right and easier to modularize and encapsulate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An object is an instance of a class.&nbsp; Write the class, then make instances from the class. If you need to change
    the object, consider if the class needs to change first.</p>

<p><strong>Reminder:</strong> Do not email your assignments to me.</p>
<p>The assignments are due on Sunday nights. There is a built-in late policy, so if you run past midnight, you can still
    hand them in. No need to check in with me to do that. If the time goes past the late policy, come and talk to me and
    I'll try and help you submit the assignment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do not attach an assignment to a submission comment, or add an attachment to an email. I will not see those. Also, I
    can not submit the assignment for you, so it will not get added to your grades in Canvas.</p>
<p>If you attach something to an email, it gets caught by the campus email filters. Once a month I get a notice of all
    of the emails that I was "protected" from and were deleted.</p>
<p>Do not email your assignments to me, please.</p>
