<p>Hi everybody and welcome to CS-119!</p>
<h3>Welcome to class!</h3>
<p>I'm looking forward to seeing everyone in class. In the meantime, you have access to the Canvas course.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will be posting and e-mailing announcements, usually on a weekly basis with notes and reminders of class activities
    such as due dates, quizzes, exams, lab hints, etc. Be sure you are using an email address that is current in Web
    Advisor
    and Canvas, and it's one you check regularly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are a few quick class orientation items to help everybody get started.</p>
<ul>
    <li>I'll be going over all of this in class, but go ahead and get started now.</li>
    <li>Make sure you are signed up for <strong><em>both</em></strong> CS-119 and CS-119L! College policy requires me to
        drop
        anybody <strong><em>not</em></strong> enrolled in both sections.<br />Even though the college has identified
        this as a
        class with a lab, there is only one course in Canvas so only one place to look.</li>
    <li>The class container on Canvas is up! Please feel free to browse around the pages to get familiar with where
        things are.
        I will be posting more class materials in the days and weeks to come. (click here for <a class="inline_disabled"

            target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Help getting started with Canvas. )</a></li>
    <li>In the Assignments area, there is a folder for the first week with lecture notes, slides and other materials for
        class.
        Download the notes, slides, lab assignment and, if you wish to work on labs using Python IDLE Development tool
        on your
        personal computer, Python IDLE is a free download.</li>
    <li>Locate the class syllabus and outline. Be sure to review these right away.</li>
    <li>We will be starting the first week with chapter 1 in the text book. Be sure to get the book as soon as possible
        and download
        the notes and slides for chapter 1.</li>
    <li>The text title and ISBN are in the syllabus as well as on Canvas. There are various online sources (Amazon,
        etc.) where you
        may be able to find the text at a discount so it pays to shop around and try to get the text prior to the class
        starting. The
        text is also available as an e-book at a substantially lower price. Rental textbooks may also be available at a
        lower price.
        Also, note that we've been using this book for several years and you are likely to find a used copy at a
        significant discount
        (highly recommended).</li>
    <li>Have a look at the first discussion activity, and get started with that. It's an important exercise and it has
        points and a
        due date associated with it!</li>
    <li>Pay attention to due dates. My goal is to get timely feedback to you, but late submissions make that much more
        difficult.</li>
    <li>Be sure to "like" the Cuyamaca CIS Department page on Facebook. This is a good source of information if you are
        looking for job,
        internship or scholarship opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next...&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Go to Module 1 to get started!</li>
</ul>
