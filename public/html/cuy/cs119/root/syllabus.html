            <dd>CS-119 is an is an introductory course in program design and development using Java or another object
                oriented programming language to serve as a foundation for more advanced programming, computer science
                or networking courses.</dd>
            <dd>This class emphasizes the development of problem-solving skills as it introduces students to computer
                science through the use of a modern object-oriented programming language. Devotes attention to the
                development of effective software engineering practices emphasizing such principles as design
                decomposition, encapsulation, procedural abstraction, testing and software reuse.</dd>
            <dd>Students will learn and apply standard programming constructs, problem-solving strategies, the concept
                of an algorithm, fundamental data structures, and the machine representation of data, introductory
                graphics and networking.</dd>
            <dt>co-requisite</dt>
            <dd>The CS-119L lab section provides tutorials, lab exercises and programming projects intended to reinforce
                the programming and design concepts taught in the CS-119 section. Note that CS-119/CS-119L will be
                taught effectively as one course. Enrollment in CS-119L as a co-requisite is mandatory!</dd>
            <dd>Beyond the need to be registered for both sections, these will be tightly integrated and be treated as a
                singal course. There will be only one course in Canvas and the grade earned will be the recorded for
                'both' courses.</dd>

            <dd>Completion of CIS-110 or a comparable introductory computer course is recommended. Students should be
                comfortable working with Microsoft Windows (10 or 11) or the MacOS (10+), using a web browser,
                uploading/downloading files, installing software and using Microsoft applications such as Word, Excel

            <dd>Upon completion of the course, the student is expected to demonstrate practical applications of software

                <ol>
                    <li>Decompose problems and design program solutions using flowcharts, pseudocode, models, or other
                        tools.</li>
                    <li>Properly code applications using the fundamental coding structures: sequence, selection, and
                        loops.</li>
                    <li>Test and debug applications using debugging tools such as trace execution.</li>

            <dt><em>Plagiarism</em></dt>
            <dd>Plagiarism hurts your personal &amp; professional reputation, the personal &amp; professional reputation
                of others, and the reputation of the college. Unless specified otherwise, all assignments in this class
                are to be completed and turned in on an individual basis. Even in the software industry, where most
                projects are done in a team environment, team members are expected to contribute substantial original
                effort to their assigned portion(s) of a project. Information technology professionals are expected to
                work to a high professional and ethical standard.</dd>
            <dd>The bottom line: You will not gain any benefit from this course if someone else is doing all the work
                and thinking for you. Plagiarism will not help get you ahead in future classes that build upon this one
                nor will it help you get ahead in the workplace!</dd>
            <dd>You are encouraged to share ideas and help each other but outright copying another's work (source code,
                documentation, etc.) will result in a zero score for all parties involved. Repeated offenses may result
                in referral for disciplinary action pursuant to the College guidelines for discipline in plagiarism
                matters. If you use the campus lab computers, make sure you take your personal storage media with you
                when you leave and don't leave hard copy source code/documentation lying around the lab or store your
                files in publicly accessible network folders.</dd>
