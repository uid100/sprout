                <p>Dear Mr. Sullivan,</p>
                <p>I was working on my assignment last night and found a coding error that I was able to work through,
                    but I missed the assignment deadline at 11:59PM, and I didn't submit it until 12:45AM. Now Canvas
                    says it's LATE. Will you accept it anyway?</p>
                <p>Sincerely,</p>
                <p>Very tired student.</p>

                <p>Hey Professor!</p>
                <p>I know that assignment is due tonight, but my grandmother fell down and hurt herself this morning and
                    I spent all day in the hospital with my family. She's going to be fine, but I still have some work
                    to complete and I don't want to rush through it.</p>
                <p>Signed,</p>

                <p><em>Hi Dan.</em></p>
                <p>As a result of the big storm that rolled through town this week, my whole crew was called in to work
                    extra shifts all week. I have been working on the lab, in my 'spare' time and it's almost done, but
                    I'd like to ask for one more day to finish it.</p>
                <p>respectfully,</p>
                <p>Busy Worker</p>

        <p>No, none of these are from real students, but all of these are very typical illustrations of emails that I
            have received. And the question always is really, "just what is the late work policy?" The simple and
            straightforward answer is, <strong>there isn't one</strong>.</p>
        <p>This is deliberate, not an oversight. All of the work is scheduled to the best of my ability. If we agree to
            stick to the schedule, a late policy has no purpose.</p>

            <li>mortgage payments,</li>
            <li>...</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These things all have "due dates."</p>

            <div id="but-why"
                style="position: relative; top: -10px; right: -10px; padding: 20px; background-color: aliceblue; border: 2px solid tan; font-style: italic;">
                <p>But wait, all of these examples are very reasonable requests, won't you reconsider?</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Yes! The fact is, I can be very sympathetic and reasonable.</p>
        <p>First, all of the assignments (and even exams!) are set up so that they are 'available' in Canvas an extra 24
            hours past their due date. When you submit them, Canvas says it's LATE.</p>
        <p>Also, your assignment may be marked with a score of 0 points after the deadline has passed. If it's still
            available (24 hours, remember?), take that "0" as a strong reminder to get the assignment wrapped up and
            submitted.</p>
        <p>When I'm grading assignments, I'm not (usually) looking at the LATE mark or that it was already graded as
            missing. I'm just assessing what you submitted and trying to give you clear and helpful feedback and when
            I'm done, the points assigned are whatever they would be.</p>
        <p>You won't lose points for handing in that assignment inside that 24 hour period.</p>
    </div>

            <div

                <p><em>Then why the 24 hours?</em></p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>I believe that there is plenty of time scheduled for each assignment and the due dates are achievable. I also
            know that not everyone has the same work/home/life schedule and things come up unexpectedly. I often prefer
            to work late at night when my workspace is quiet and uninterrupted and unhurried. So if something did come
            up and I missed, or am missing a deadline, at least I still have those quiet hours to scramble (once in a
            while) to get caught up.</p>
    </div>

            <p>Ok, I get that, but this situation is different and my....</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>Wow! I'm very sorry (or glad maybe?) that happened. Really. I can be very reasonable.</p>
    <p>This class is a priority to me and to you. If it wasn't, we wouldn't be having these conversations. And I also
        agree that there are so many things in life that are far more important than this class! Come to my office hours
        and let me know which assignment it was. If there is time on the calendar (<em>even I can't change the
            calendar</em>) then I can edit dates and make the assignment available for you to submit an old, or missed
        assignment then and there. Yes, even that one that was from three weeks ago. There are always good reasons and
        I'm willing to do some extra work to help you succeed. That really is why I'm here.</p>
    <p>I just ask that you don't take advantage of me.</p>
    <p>If you ask me to open several weeks of old assignments because you just didn't get to them, or because you've
        been saving them, I may say "no." (Officially, there isn't a late policy, remember?) I might just not have time,
        especially if I'm getting more than a handful of requests.</p>
    <p>Also, <em>things happen</em> only once in a while. If I get asked frequently, or for several assignments, I may
        try to help, but at best I'll be unhappy, and you don't want an unhappy person assessing your work. Yes, I can
        make exceptions, but they have to be exceptions, not regular occurences. It's not fair to me, to you, or to
        other students that finished on time.</p>

        <div

            <p><em>Then why do we even have a schedule?</em></p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>If everyone learns differently, and at a different pace, why indeed?</p>
    <p>The school has scheduled a block of time and resources for each class to complete a set of learning objectives.
        It should be no surprise that there are many factors considered in that scheduling. Likewise, each course is
        divided into smaller pieces of achievable blocks of learning and, like in our case, these build on each other.
    </p>
    <p>By keeping up with the schedule as designed, there is time to complete the assignments, and I have time to grade
        them and get feedback to you for next time.</p>
    <p>I guess there's a policy after all.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Good talk.</p>
