        <div id="introduction">
            <p>This lab activity gives you an opportunity to apply some of the programming principles presented in
                chapter 9 of the text book. You will be revisiting some previous labs and reworking them into GUI
                applications. Updating an existing application with new features and/or functional changes is very much
                a part of &ldquo;real world&rdquo; software development.</p>

        <div id="gui" style="padding: 20px;">
            <p>GUI programming in Python or any other language can get complicated &ndash; especially if you must do it
                all in code! There are numerous GUI controls, numerous ways to design/layout the GUI, set colors, align
                controls, etc. However, in this lab, a very basic approach will be used. Once you complete this first
                exercise, you will find that you can easily replicate the work you did here to the remaining exercises.
            </p>
            <p>Most modern programming language libraries provide a set of commonly used GUI controls (often referred to
                as components or widgets). These include labels, buttons, text boxes, check boxes, etc. These are all
                pre-coded, tested and immediately available for any GUI application you wish to create.</p>
            <p>When creating a GUI, you will start with a form (sometimes referred to as a frame or a canvas) and then
                add the various user interface controls you wish to use. Most GUI libraries have various layout managers
                to help you arrange your controls on the form. In this lab, you will use a grid layout for the simple
                reason it&rsquo;s the easiest to learn and use.</p>
            <p>For getting user input you will use the Python Entry (single line text box). For labeling each Entry
                (text box), you will use Label controls. You will also use label controls for displaying output as these
                can&rsquo;t be modified by the user. For initiating actions, you will use buttons.</p>
            <p>From chapter 9 in the text book, you learned the GUI environment is event driven. A GUI that responds to
                no events is completely useless! For this lab, you will write code often referred to as an event handler
                or callback function to respond to when the user presses (clicks) a button on the form.</p>

            <h2 class="alert">Exercise 1 (Guided)</h2>
            <h3>Gas Mileage Calculator</h3>
            <p>That Python console application you did earlier in the semester to compute gas mileage and cost per mile
                is a bit outdated! It&rsquo;s time to modernize it with a GUI. Your application must allow the user to
                enter the number of miles driven, number of gallons put into the gas tank and cost in dollars per gallon
                of gas. Your outputs must include MPG, total fuel cost and cost per mile.</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: none; margin: 20px;">Key formulas:
                <li>mpg = milesDriven / gallons</li>
                <li>totalFuelCost = gallons * costPerGallon</li>
                <li>costPerMile = totalFuelCost / milesDriven</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Before writing any code, <strong>revise</strong> your pseudocode from before and <strong>update</strong>
                it with the new steps for creating the GUI. The subtle lesson here: Your pseudocode/flowchart and other
                system design documents are living documents for the life of your project; meaning you should be
                revising them as you add features, fix bugs, make functional changes, etc.</p>
            <p>Being a guided exercise, you are given the Python code:</p>
            <p class="ic-flash-info">OOPS! there's a typo in this code. As discussed in class, lines 78 &amp; 79 should
                be btnCalc, not btnExit.</p>

            <h3>BMI</h3>
            <p>For this exercise, you will update another previous lab exercise with a GUI. Design and develop an
                application that allows the user to enter their height in inches, weight in pounds and then calculate
                their body mass index (BMI). To calculate BMI, we will use the following formulas:</p>
            <p style="padding: 30px;">bmi = kilograms / meters2</p>
            <p>Be sure to set the form size to fit your inputs, outputs and controls.</p>
            <p>Once you calculate the BMI percentage, you will need to display one of the messages below based on the
                BMI percentage calculated.</p>
            <table class="table table-striped">

            <h3>Coyote Inn</h3>
            <p>Coyote Inn has asked you to modernize the application you developed to estimate charges for staying at
                their new inn with a graphical user interface. From the original exercise, their nightly rates are based
                on months of the year and provided in the following table:</p>

            <p>To keep things simple, you can still allow the month to be entered by the month number. Normally, this
                would be done by a date period but do it by month number to keep the exercise simple.</p>
            <p>The user must be able to enter a month number (1 &ndash; 12) and the number of nights. Use a decision
                structure to find the correct price per night for the month entered and then multiply it by the number
                of nights entered.</p>
            <p>You may update the pseudocode or flowchart you completed for the original exercise. Be sure to clearly
                indicate the event handler(s) from the mainloop.</p>
