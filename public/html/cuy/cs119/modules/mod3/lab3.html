        <div id="introduction">
            <p>This lab provides an opportunity to apply the concepts and principles presented in chapter 3 of the PLD
                text.</p>
            <p>To save time, space and reading, all the nitty-gritty details of how to create a Python code file in
                IDLE, how to create the pseudocode file, etc. will be mostly left out. Please refer to the chapter 1 lab
                if you need a more detailed refresher on these steps. However, we will review problem analysis and
                pseudocode in quite a bit of detail in this exercise. We&rsquo;ll focus more on the chapter concepts and
                the Python code needed to complete this problem as well as things you&rsquo;ll need to know to complete
                the rest of this lab.</p>

            <div id="ex1-intro">
                <p>This exercise is based on exercise 9 on pages 112 and 113 of the text. In this exercise, a portrait
                    studio has hired you to implement a charge calculator for taking portraits. Part of the charge is
                    based on the number of subjects in the portrait.</p>

                <h3>Analyzing the Problem</h3>
                <p>From the previous chapters, we know we can break this problem down into input, process and output.
                </p>
                <p>What inputs do we need? Let&rsquo;s look at the problem and see if we can identify them:</p>
                <p><img src="https://gcccd.instructure.com/courses/55916/files/9873470/preview"
                        alt="analyze the problem" width="562" height="132"
                        data-api-endpoint="https://gcccd.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/55916/files/9873470"
                        data-api-returntype="File" /></p>
                <p>Now that we&rsquo;ve identified the inputs of last name, number of subjects and the scheduled day of
                    the week, our pseudocode will look something like this:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 30px;">Get last_name<br />Get num_subjects<br />Get
                    day_of_week<br />&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
                <p>Next, let&rsquo;s break down the processing.</p>
                <p>In this exercise, last name really isn&rsquo;t used for anything. In a <em>real world</em>
                    application, data such as last name, address, billing information, etc. would be entered and stored
                    in either a file or database and used for billing, delivering the portraits, etc.</p>
                <p>We&rsquo;ve been given a fee schedule based on the number of subjects for calculating the base price.
                </p>
                <p>Portraits sittings on Saturday or Sunday are 20% extra.</p>
                <p>These are the 2 processing steps we need but is this clear enough that we could write code?
                    Let&rsquo;s be honest with ourselves, probably not. So, let&rsquo;s break these steps down a little
                    further. Keep in mind there are a number of ways this problem could be solved. What&rsquo;s
                    presented here is simply one of a number of possible ways so don&rsquo;t take this as the only
                    solution or the way you have to do it. If you have a different approach you want to take, go for it!
                </p>
                <p>To calculate the base price using the table above, we need to code a decision structure. In the
                    chapter, we saw that we can use an if/else (dual alternative) decision structure. Since we have a
                    number of choices, we&rsquo;ll need to do an expanded, not covered in the PLD text version of this
                    called an if/else if/else structure. Our pseudocode will look something like this:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 30px;">&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br />if num_subjects = 1
                    then<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;base_price = 100<br />else if num_subjects = 2
                    then<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;base_price = 130<br />else if num_subjects = 3
                    then<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;base_price = 150<br />else if num_subjects = 4
                    then<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;base_price = 165<br />else if num_subjects = 5
                    then<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;base_price = 175<br />else if num_subjects = 6
                    then<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;base_price = 180<br />else // default catch all 7 or
                    more<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;base_price = 185<br />end if<br />&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
                <p>Decision structures like this are heavily used in real world programming so it&rsquo;s beneficial to
                    get experience working with these.</p>
                <p>The next thing is to determine if an additional 20% charge applies. This gets charged if the sitting
                    is on Saturday or Sunday. Once again, there are multiple, possible ways to approach this. We could
                    use an if/else if/else decision structure or we could use a single alternative structure and use the
                    logical OR operator. Here&rsquo;s the pseudocode for both approaches. Both will work and there are
                    other ways that would work too. The choice of which one to use here is really a matter of personal
                    preference.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 30px;">&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br />#(Dual alternative:)<br />if day_of_week = 7
                    then<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;base_price = base_price * 1.2<br />else if day_of_week = 1
                    then<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;base_price = base_price *
                    1.2<br />else<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// do nothing &ndash; no additional charge<br />end
                    if<br />&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 30px;">&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br />#(Single alternative:)<br />if day_of_week = 7
                    OR day_of_week = 1 then &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;base_price = base_price * 1.2 end
                    if<br />&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
                <p>To help guide your final decision, which of these two structures looks easier to code later on?</p>
                <p>Notice in both cases we simply accumulate or add to (well, multiply in this case) the base charge if
                    the condition is true.</p>
                <p>Another point here is the value 1.2 for the surcharge is often called a magic number; its meaning and
                    purpose is unclear. This makes for code that is more difficult to read and understand. To make
                    things more readable and maintainable, let&rsquo;s add a constant called SURCHARGE_PCT and assign it
                    the value 1.2. In languages like Python, Java, C++ and C#, it is customary to declare constants in
                    all upper case letters and use the underscore (_) to space multiple words. The idea is to make them
                    really stick out and not be mistaken for variables. Since Python doesn&rsquo;t have constants and it
                    turns out these are really variables, be careful not to change the values of your Python
                    &ldquo;constants&rdquo; after you declare them.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 30px;">&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br />SURCHARGE_PCT = 1.2<br /><br />#(Revised Single
                    alternative using constants:)<br />if day_of_week = 7 OR day_of_week = 1 then
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;base_price = base_price * SURCHARGE_PCT end if<br />&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
                </p>
                <p>Last thing is output.</p>
                <p>Notice that our total price is actually stored in the variable base_price so the pseudocode is very
                    simply the line:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 30px;">&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br />Display base_price</p>

                <h4>Designing the Solution</h4>
                <p>Create a file called PortraitStudio in IDLE. Be sure to create this on your USB drive if you are
                    using the lab computers. Create a blank text file for your pseudocode and name it pseudocode.txt.

            <div id="pseudocode">
                <p>Here&rsquo;s all the pseudocode we saw earlier all in one place. Keep in mind this sample pseudocode
                    is a suggested approach that will work. You are welcome and encouraged to develop your own approach
                    and style.</p>

                <p>Another thing we are going to do in this lab is generate some test data we can use when we test to
                    ensure our application is working correctly and producing correct results.</p>
                <p>We need test data for a varying number of subjects (test the selection structure) and we also need to
                    test the weekend surcharge feature. Having a good table of test input data and the expected results
                    allows us to test our application and be able to tell at a glance if it is working correctly.</p>
                <p>To keep things simple, we will add it to our pseudocode. It doesn&rsquo;t need to be anything fancy
                    but should have enough values that we can test all possible scenarios.</p>

            <h3>BMI Calculator</h3>
            <p>For this exercise, you will design and develop an application that allows the user to enter their height
                in inches, weight in pounds and then calculate their body mass index (BMI). To calculate BMI (kilograms
                per square meter), we will use the following formulas:</p>
            <p style="padding: 30px;">bmi = kilograms / ( meters * meters )</p>
            <p><em>Wait a minute! What&rsquo;s going on here?</em></p>
            <p>Before we can do the calculation above, we need to convert weight in pounds to weight in kilograms and
                height in inches to meters. We also need these formulas:</p>
            <p style="padding: 20px;">meters = inches / 39.36<br />kilograms = pounds / 2.2</p>
            <p>Once you calculate the BMI percentage, you will need to display one of the messages below based on the
                BMI percentage calculated.</p>
            <table class="table table-striped">

            <p>To keep things simple, you can allow the month to be entered by the month number. Normally, this would be
                done by a date period but we&rsquo;ll do it by month to keep the exercise simple.</p>
            <p>The user must be able to enter a month number (1 &ndash; 12) and the number of nights. Use a decision
                structure to find the correct price per night for the month entered and then multiply it by the number
                of nights entered.</p>
            <p style="font-style: italic;">Be sure to test all ranges and make sure your calculations are correct.</p>
            <p style="font-style: italic;">Be sure to include a table of test data and expected results with your
                pseudocode.</p>
