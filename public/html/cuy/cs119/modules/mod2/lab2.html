        <h2 class="alert">Lab #2</h2>
        <div id="introduction">
            <p>This lab continues the introduction to programming in Python and writing sequential code. You will be
                creating 2 Python console applications using Python IDLE. It also gives you an opportunity to get a
                little more hands-on experience with the terminology and concepts presented in chapters 1 &amp; 2 of the
                PLD text.</p>
            <p>There are two exercises in this lab. Be sure to complete both.</p>
            <p>As we progress through these labs, the detailed step-by-step instructions will be omitted for things
                already covered and more focused on any new material being covered. Before you start this lab, be sure
                you are comfortable with the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Starting Python IDLE</li>
                <li>Creating a pseudocode.txt file for your pseudocode.</li>
                <li>Creating Python code files</li>
                <li>Getting user input using the input() method</li>
                <li>Displaying output using the print() method</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Review Lab 1 if you&rsquo;re unclear on any of the above.</p>

            <h3>Text Message Cost Calculator</h3>
            <div id="ex1-intro">
                <p>This exercise is based on exercise 6, page 61 of the PLD text. Besides pseudocode, you will write
                    working Python code as well.</p>
                <p>Develop an application that will allow the user to enter the number of text messages sent in the last
                    month. Messages are 0.25 each and a 9% tax is added to the total.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="steps">
                <h4>Steps</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Start Python IDLE.</li>
                    <li>Create your pseudocode.txt file. For all labs, you may put your pseudocode for all the exercises
                        in a single file to save time and make things easier. Be sure to have comments or notes
                        indicating which pseudocode is for which exercise. It will help you score some points!</li>
                    <li>Write your pseudocode. Once again, keep in mind there is no single &ldquo;correct&rdquo; way of
                        doing it. What are the inputs? What processing and formulas are needed? What are the outputs?
                    </li>
                    <li>Create a new file and save as TextMessage.py to your Lab 1 folder. Note that Python source files
                        must have the .py extension.</li>
                    <li>Be sure to save your work!</li>
                    <li>Run your application. Select Run Module from the Run menu.</li>
                    <li>Choose test values where you can easily verify that your program is producing the correct
                        output.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Go to Exercise 2!</p>
        </div>
        <div id="ex2" style="padding: 20px;">
            <h2 class="alert">Exercise 2</h2>
            <h3>Gas Mileage Calculator</h3>
            <p>In this exercise, you will create another Python application to compute gas mileage and gas cost per
                mile. Your application must allow the user to enter the number of miles driven, number of gallons put
                into the gas tank and cost in dollars per gallon of gas. Your outputs must include MPG, total fuel cost
                and cost per mile.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Key formulas:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>mpg = milesDriven / gallons</li>
                <li>totalFuelCost = gallons * costPerGallon</li>
                <li>costPerMile = totalFuelCost / milesDriven</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Before writing any code, write some pseudocode as it will help you break down the problem into
                understandable pieces. Also, it&rsquo;s worth points! To save time, you may add your pseudocode for this
                exercise to the pseudocode file you created in exercise 1.</p>
            <p>You will create the Python file the same way you did in exercise 1.</p>
