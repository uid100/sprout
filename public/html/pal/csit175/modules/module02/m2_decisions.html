        <h3>Boolean Expressions</h3>
        <p>
            Sequential processing consists of passing an ordered list of instructions
            through a processor. Do step 1, then step 2, step 3, and step 4, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
            Often, in any sequential list of instructions there will be conditional
            execution. If it's raining outside, then find an umbrella. If the dog is
            scratching at the door, then open the door and let her go outside. If it
            is your grandmother's birthday, then we will be joining her for dinner at
            her favorite restaurant.
        </p>
        <p>
            Conditional execution involves evaluating a boolean expression. This is a
            binary expression. It can only evaluate to</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>True</code> or <code>False</code>, </li>
            <li><code>Yes</code> or <code>No</code>, </li>
            <li><code>On</code> or <code>Off</code>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
            Here are some examples of boolean expressions.

            <li>x < y</li>
            <li>a >= b</li>
            <li>word1 == word2</li>

            <li>temperature > 75 or humidity < 60</li>
            <li>count != 0</li>

            <li>not is_empty or is_full</li>
            <li>grade == 'A' or grade == 'B'</li>

            <li>not (is_morning and is_weekday)</li>

        <h3>Python Conditional Statements: if, elif, else</h3>
        <p>
            In Python, the if statement is used to conditionally execute a block of code.
            The keyword <code>if</code> is followed by a boolean expression and a colon,
            then the conditional code to be executed is indented (typically 4 spaces) and
            then processing returns from the code block by un-indenting to the same column
            that it started.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example:
        </p>
        <pre>
            if TODAY == "Friday":
                print("Weekend is almost here!")
                hours_worked += 8
            print(TODAY)</pre>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>In Python, conditional statements are used to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions.
            The key components for this are the <code>if</code>, <code>elif</code> (else if), and <code>else</code>
            statements.</p>

        <h2><strong><em>if</em></strong> Statement:</h2>
        <p>The <code>if</code> statement is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition evaluates to
            <code>True</code>. Here's the basic syntax:
        </p>

        <pre><code>if condition:
    # Code to be executed if the condition is True
  </code></pre>

        <h2><strong><em>elif</em></strong> Statement:</h2>
        <p>The <code>elif</code> statement allows you to check additional conditions if the previous <code>if</code> or
            <code>elif</code> conditions are not met. It stands for "else if." Here's how it works:
        </p>

        <pre><code>if condition:
    # Code to be executed if the condition is True
elif another_condition:
    # Code to be executed if another_condition is True
  </code></pre>

        <h2><strong><em>else</em></strong> Statement:</h2>
        <p>The <code>else</code> statement is used to execute a block of code when none of the previous conditions (in
            <code>if</code> or <code>elif</code>) are true. It acts as a fallback. Here's the syntax:
        </p>

        <pre><code>if condition:
    # Code to be executed if the condition is True
elif another_condition:
    # Code to be executed if another_condition is True
else:
    # Code to be executed if none of the above conditions are True
  </code></pre>

        <p>Together, these statements provide a way to create structured and controlled flow in your Python programs,
            allowing for different code paths based on varying conditions.</p>

        <p>
            Notice that the <code>elif</code> statement is not just another <code>if</code> statement. It relies on
            the first <code>if</code> condition to be evaluated as <code>False</code> or it will never be evaluated.
        </p>
        <p>
            Likewise, any <code>else</code> statements won't execute unless all of the previous <code>if</code> and
            <code>elif</code> boolean conditions have evaluated as false.
        </p>
        <p>
            Remember that not all <code>if</code> statements will need an <code>else</code> statement.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, remember that all <code>if</code> and <code>elif</code> statements must have a corresponding
            boolean expression, and an <code>else</code> statement never will.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Indenting</h3>
        <p>
            As <em>forgiving</em> and <em>simple</em> as the Python programming language tends to be,
            be aware that it is <em>very</em> particular about indentation. Each code block is identified
            and distinguished by the level of indentation, and returning to the previous indentation level
            after the code block is executed. By default, this should always be 4 spaces. In fact, the language
            isn't particular about how many spaces as long as it's consistent and always the same.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a general rule, every popular code editor will translate the Tab character to a fixed number
            of spaces. It's a good idea to get in the habit of using the [Tab] key to enter the correct
            number of spaces, and not the spacebar. The [Tab] key won't get it wrong.
        </p>
