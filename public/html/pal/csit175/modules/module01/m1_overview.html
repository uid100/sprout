                    It's customary to meet and introduce ourselves. It's not a bad thing.<br />
                    And I have a Discussion board set up just for that purpose.

            <h3 style="font-style: italic;">Me</h3>
            <p>My career began in research. In that environment, I was primarily responsible for finding creative
                solutions for real world data collection and analysis in challenging environments. Sometimes it meant
                writing software for instrument control and data processing on a small ship rolling in heavy seas.
                Sometimes I was building cabinets, designing and creating electrical and plumbing solutions for a mobile
                shipboard lab facility. Sometimes it was negotiating with shipping agents and import/export
                documentation in foreign ports. Always, it involved a changing set of requirements, analysis, design,
                and implementation.</p>
            <p>Moving into the private sector, I ran IT departments for large banking operations, again looking for
                creative solutions to apply emerging technologies.</p>
            <p>Then, for many more years, I worked as a systems engineer and later project and program manager for large
                government contractors.</p>
            <p>
                I still work part-time as a consultant, both as program manager and systems software engineer. I began
                teaching and for the last few years I've had the pleasure of teaching a variety of computer science
                topics at a number of different colleges and universities.

            <div class="on-campus" style="visibility: visible;">
                <h4>Classroom Meetings</h4>
                <p>We will meet in class each week according to the course schedule. Please by on time and treat our
                    classroom as the professional environment that it is. See syllabus for more.</p>
                <p>Assignments and quizzes are due each week. See the schedule for dates. The materials for each module
                    will be available by the start of each week, and I will try and make them available sooner. You
                    should read the chapter and start the exercises for each module before class. I will be going over
                    the materials, walking through examples, and answering questions, but you will get more out of the
                    class if it is not your first time seeing the material.</p>
                <p>Complete your assignments and get them submitted on time. It is my goal to get your projects graded
                    before the class meeting the next week so that I can answer questions about them. I can't guarantee
                    that late assignments will be graded. Late and missing assignments are not fair to me, to you, or to
                    other students who are turning them in on time. See the syllabus for more details about my policy on
                    late work.</p>
            </div> <!-- #on-campus -->
            <p>This course is designed to be very much a <em>hands-on</em> experience. Try and search for solutions when
                you run into challenges and try to apply them. There will be some reading and some videos to explain
                finer points of solutions development, and more importantly there will be opportunities to design and
                create.</p>

        <ul style="margin-left: 15%;">
            <li>You will submit all your work through Canvas.</li>
            <li>You'll find everything you need under Modules and Assignments.</li>
            <li>Each Module will contain:
                <ul>
                    <li>Weekly Instructions and Overview</li>

                    <li>Review the weekly material.</li>
                    <li>Complete weekly assignments.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Canvas Modules</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The course <i>container</i> here on Canvas is divided into modules. Each module may have an
                    associated
                    chapter from the book, sometimes two. During each module, we will be covering the material from the
                    assigned chapter(s). There may be additional material that requires some internet research. Some of
                    the modules will be completed in one week, some are scheduled across two weeks.</li>
                <li>You can see the schedule, module-by-module, and week-by-week at the bottom of the Syllabus. It is
                    also
                    summarized on the course home page or you can view the detail on the Canvas calendar.</li>
                <li>Keep track of the schedule for labs and quizzes. These are worth points! You are responsible for
                    assignment due dates posted in Canvas. Nobody will chase you to turn in assignments.</li>
                <li>In each chapter module, you will find learning resources such as PowerPoint slides, lecture notes,
                    videos, sample Python code for many of the chapters, and links to assignments such as labs and
                    quizzes.
                </li>
                <li>Being the first week of class, much of our activity this week is going to be orientation stuff like
                    the
                    syllabus, outline and lab standards, getting the textbook, downloading/installing the Python IDLE on
                    your own personal computers and we will jump into the first two chapters of the textbook.</li>
            </ul>

        <p class="ic-flash-info">The first week of class might seem overwhelming (and long!) but hang in there.</p>

        <div id="resources" style="padding: 20px;">
            <h3>Notes and Resources</h3>
            <p>The goal of each module is to make available to you a variety of learning resources and give you an
                organized list of materials to help you master each chapter. Everybody learns differently so I'm going
                to leave it mostly up to you to choose and use the materials that help you learn best.</p>
            <p>The Power Point slides are from the publisher and correspond to the textbook. Many people find these
                slides helpful as a study guide for the chapter and for taking notes.</p>
            <p>There may be helpful links on the #resources channel on Discord also, as well as friendly people to help
                answer questions. See the Discord link on the front page and the syllabus to join my server and online
                class discussions.</p>
        </div> <!-- #resources -->
        <div id="practice" style="padding: 20px;">
            <h3>Practice, practice, practice.</h3>
            <p>If this is your first time taking any kind of programming course, don't panic - you're in the right
                place! It may not seem like it at times but really, you are. Learning a programming language is much
                like learning a foreign language or learning to play a musical instrument. The key and secret is
                practice! You have to immerse yourself and get involved hands-on. Simply trying to skim the chapter or a
                quick look at the sample code isn't going to do you a whole lot of good.</p>
            <div class="ic-flash-info">Coding is fun.</div>
            <p>In almost every lab assignment, there will be at least one guided programming exercise designed to
                prepare you for completing the remaining lab exercises.</p>
            <p>We will work on these together in class but you are encouraged to work them on your own ahead of time and
                bring your questions and share your experience.</p>

        <p>Yes. There are probably some. This is an evolving course and much of what you are seeing is very much a work
            in progress. If you have questions or find something that just doesn't make sense, it may well be that
            something is missing, incorrect, images not appearing, broken links, or something that could just be
            clearer. Please let me know.</p>
