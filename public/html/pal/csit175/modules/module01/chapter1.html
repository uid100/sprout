    <h3>Editions</h3>
    <p>
        I have the 2nd Edition of the textbook and I think it is very good. While preparing
        for this class, I also purchased the first edition to compare them side by side, and
        the content in the new edition is good, but really there is very little added or
        changed in the book, so if you can find a used copy of the either edition, you will
        not have any trouble following the content.
    </p>

    <h3>General</h3>
    <p>
        My thoughts and observations on computer programming <em>textbooks in general</em> are that
        typically, the first chapter is dedicated to sharing the author's perspective of
        the history of the particular language or topic, how, when, and why it became its
        current state, and why it matters.
    </p>
    <p>
        For experienced developers, this information is often though-provoking and relevant.
        In many cases, this information will be lost or ignored by beginning developers.
        Often, I recommend that students browse the contents of the first chapter, read any
        sections that are familiar or interesting, and gloss over historical or comparative
        facts. I do feel that in most cases, the chapter one material is worth revisiting
        after the student has gained some experience with the next few chapters and has
        enough foundational knowledge to appreciate and understand the author's perspective.
    </p>
    <p>
        Again, this is a generalization.
    </p>

    <h3>Reading Programming Textbooks</h3>
    <p>
        My advice for reading all textbooks, and especially programming textbooks is to
        start with the Table of Contents. The author will have divided the material into
        manageable pieces and subdivided these into sections and assigned meaningful
        headers to each. The Table of Contents is machine generated from these Chapter
        section headers and subheaders. It is therefore, a carefully designed outline
        of the subject material.
    </p>
    <p>
        Starting with the Table of Contents, read through the list of topics that you
        will be learning. Which are familiar already? Which are of particular interest?
        Which are confusing or completely unfamiliar? This preview of the chapter agenda
        is helpful and may prepare your mindset to look for particular points.
    </p>
    <p>
        Prepared with having read the outline, read through the content, always with
        your computer ready. Enter and try all code examples for yourself. These
        demonstrations usually build on themselves, and it's worth taking the time to
        try them yourself to find what works and what doesn't.
    </p>
    <p>
        Take side-trips. Follow rabbit-trails. Find out how a piece of code really works
        by changing it. Try modifying it in different ways. Understand not just that
        you can copy and pasted someone else's example, but why it works by finding out
        how to break it.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a final step, and while the material is still fresh, go back to the Table of
        Contents and read through this outline again. Do each of the topics have a
        different meaning to you now? Do you remember what you read? Did you miss some
        content that you want to go back and refresh or clarify?
    </p>
    <p class="ic-flash-info">
        If you are reading for retention, always start <em>and</em> finish with reviewing
        this outline.
    </p>
    <h3>Murachâ€™s Pyhton programming</h3>
    <p>
        The first chapter in this book has a lot of sample code. Some will be easy to
        follow and try, some will be more confusing. In this first chapter, if you are
        not able to replicate all of the author's results, make a note of your observations
        and come back to it later. Some will take more time to reveal.
    </p>
    <p>
        After the first chapter though, be sure to try all of the code you encounter.
