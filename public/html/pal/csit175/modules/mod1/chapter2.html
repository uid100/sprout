    <h2 class="alert alert-info">Chapter 2 How to write your first programs</h2>
    <h3>Bridging the gap</h3>
    <p>
        Unless you were created by processing silicon wafers into transducers, logic chips, solder
        and electronic components, then learning a computer programming language <em>is</em>
        learning a foreign language. And like studying spoken languages the best way to learn
        is through immersion. To speak the language you must <em>practice</em> speaking the
        language.
    </p>
    <p>
        So it is with programming. Programming languages are common human language logic instructions
        which can be converted into simple instructions that the machine can follow. Like spoken
        languages, there are vocabulary and grammar rules to learn. When you learned to communicate in
        any language, you did not start with the entire language but simple words and phrases becoming
        more complex over time. With programming languages, you are introduced to a few concepts to
        try and to analyze, before diving into more complex patterns.
    </p>
    <p>
        As you learn more programming languages, you will see how they are different and how they
        are similar. The rules of <em>grammar</em>> are called syntax. <em>Vocabulary</em> are a
        language's built-in keywords.
    </p>
    <p>
        When learning any programming language, the goal is to bridge the human-machine interface
        as early as possible. A new developer wants to be able to make the computer follow their
        instructions and respond in a predictable way.
    </p>
    <h3>Python code processing</h3>
    <p>
        Programming languages are designed to use common spoken language to pass logical instructions.
        Python is no exception. We will use a <strong>print</strong> command to output information to
        a computer console, <strong>input</strong> to get information from a user, <strong>int</strong>,
        <strong>float</strong>, and <strong>str</strong> to convert data to integers, floating point
        (rational) numbers, or strings.
    </p>
    <p>
        A list or <em>sequence</em> of these computer instructions is written in a source code listing
        or text file which a program reads and converts to instructions the processor can step through
        and follow.
    </p>
    <h3>HelloWorld</h3>
    <p>
        "Hello, World!" is a common programming tradition where the first program written by someone
        learning a new programming language or environment simply outputs the message "Hello, World!"
        to the screen or console. It's a simple way for programmers to test that their development
        environment is set up correctly and that they can successfully write, compile, and run a basic
        program.
    </p>
    <pre>
            print("Hello, World!")
    </pre>
    <p>
        The idea is to keep it simple and focus on the fundamental syntax and structure of the language.
        It serves as a quick introduction for beginners to understand how to write a basic program in
        a specific programming language.
    </p>
    <h3>Data persistence</h3>
    <p>
        Computers are not intrinsically <em>smart</em>. They are very limited in their capabilities
        in spite of what you may have heard. In there are only two things a computer can do, and it
        does them very well.
    </p>
    <p>
        First, a computer can process simple instructions very, <em>very</em> quickly. Much faster
        than any human mind is capable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Second, it can remember things very well, if designed correctly, indefinitely.
    </p>
    <p>
        For either of these to be useful, we need to be a way of declaring and using data in our
        programs and we do that with variables.
    </p>
    <p>
        In programming, a variable is a symbolic name or identifier associated with a value or data.
        It acts as a container that stores information that can be referenced and manipulated in a
        program. Variables are essential for working with data and performing operations on that
        data within a computer program.
    </p>
    <pre>
        # Variable assignment
        age = 25

        # Variable usage in an expression
        double_age = age * 2

        # Printing the result
        print("Age:", age)
        print("Double Age:", double_age)
    </pre>
    <p>
        Try the code in Chapter 2.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pay close attention to the differences between integers, floating point numbers, and
        strings.
