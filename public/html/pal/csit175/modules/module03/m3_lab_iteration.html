            This time, in addition to writing Python source code, you will also create two (2) flowcharts as they
            are commonly used as design documents to communicate programming structure, and they are a good
            graphical representation of looping structures.
        </p>
        <p>
            You'll find all of the instructions to do this below. Take your time. Details matter.

            <h3>A Guided Python Application &ndash; Exponents and Factorials</h3>
            <div id="ex1-intro">
                <h4>Description</h4>
                <p>Loops or repetition structures are used extensively in software development so it&rsquo;s very
                    important to get comfortable coding these. The exercise we&rsquo;re going to do here isn&rsquo;t
                    necessarily real practical but it does illustrate the use of loops for a couple of common arithmetic
                    operations. The first one we&rsquo;ll do is an exponent function. Most modern programming languages
                    have either an exponent operator (I.e., Visual Basic, Python) or a built-in library function (Java,
                    C#) to calculate exponents so, once again, we&rsquo;re doing this just to get some hands-on practice
                    coding loops. The other arithmetic operation we&rsquo;ll do is the factorial function.</p>
                <h4>Design</h4>
                <p>This time around, we&rsquo;ll do a flowchart. Keep in mind a flowchart is like pseudocode except in a
                    more graphical form.</p>
                <p class="ic-flash-info" style="padding: 20px;">Read the instructions carefully. You will practice with
                    two different functions in this first Exercise (1).</p>
            </div>
            <hr />
            <div id="flowchart">
                <h3>Creating Flowcharts</h3>
                <p>First, review the basic flowchart shapes.</p>
                <p><img src="/courses/49289/file_contents/course%20files/course_image/lab03/flowchart_shapes.png"
                        alt="review flowchart shapes" /></p>
                <p>fig.1 Flowchart Shapes</p>
                <p>For doing exponents, we know from past math classes the expression 24 is really a shorthand notation
                    for the expression 2*2*2*2. This looks like something we could do with a loop, right? Let&rsquo;s
                    give it a shot. We&rsquo;ll use the online tool <a href="http://draw.io"
                        style="color:navy;">Draw.io</a>. It functions
                    very similar to Microsoft Visio.</p>
                <p>Start out by creating a new diagram.</p>
                <p><img src="/courses/49289/file_contents/course%20files/course_image/lab03/new-diagram.png"
                        alt="new diagram" /></p>
                <p>fig.2 New Diagram</p>
                <p>Select (1) Blank Diagram and then (2) Create.</p>
                <p><img src="/courses/49289/file_contents/course%20files/course_image/lab03/create_blank.png"
                        alt="create from blank" /></p>
                <p>fig.3 Create from Blank</p>
                <p>You can also select Flowcharts and then Create.</p>
                <p><img src="/courses/49289/file_contents/course%20files/course_image/lab03/create_flowchart.png"
                        alt="create from flowchart template" /></p>
                <p>fig.4 or Create from Flowcharts</p>
                <p class="ic-flash-info">Which shapes you choose matter. Hover over each shape in the palette to find
                    its correct purpose.</p>
                <p>You will get a blank drawing with various tool palettes of shapes on the left side. Expand Flowchart.
                    The &ldquo;key&rdquo; shapes we&rsquo;ll be using are highlighted below. Select a shape, hold down
                    the left mouse button, and then drag and then drop the shape onto the page. Double-click the shape
                    to add text. A &ldquo;proper&rdquo; flowchart will have a distinct start and end; all shapes will
                    have appropriate labels, and all structures will have a single entry and exit point.</p>
                <p><img src="/courses/49289/file_contents/course%20files/course_image/lab03/flow_shapes.png"
                        alt="common flowchart shapes" /></p>
                <p>fig.5 Common flowchart shapes for this exercise</p>
                <p>First, drag and drop a Start/End oval (or &ldquo;lozenge&rdquo; as the textbook likes to call it)
                    onto the page. Double-click the oval and label it as either &ldquo;Start&rdquo; or
                    &ldquo;Begin&rdquo;. Drag and drop a Data (Input/Output) parallelogram onto the page. If you hover
                    over the parallelogram in the Flowchart shapes palette, you will see it is used to indicate "Data".
                </p>
                <p>To save time and space, we&rsquo;ll combine our inputs into one shape. Double-click the parallelogram
                    and enter the required inputs. In this case, we need the number and the power or exponent. Your
                    flowchart should look something like this:</p>
                <p><img src="/courses/49289/file_contents/course%20files/course_image/lab03/get-inputs.png"
                        alt="get inputs" /></p>
                <p>fig.6 Get inputs</p>
                <p>Click on the Start oval and drag the flow line/arrow to the parallelogram. You can also use the
                    Connector tool in the tool bar to draw flow lines. Be aware getting flowlines drawn correctly can be
                    a bit of a trial and error process. The flowchart should now look something like this:</p>
                <p><img src="/courses/49289/file_contents/course%20files/course_image/lab03/adding-flowlines.png"
                        alt="adding flow-lines" /></p>
                <p><img src="/courses/49289/file_contents/course%20files/course_image/lab03/added-flowlines.png"
                        alt="added flow-lines" /></p>
                <p>fig.7&amp;8 Add flow-lines</p>
                <p>Note how the arrow on the connector always points to the next step.</p>
                <p>Next, drag and drop a process box (rectangle) onto the page, double-click and initialize the loop
                    counter with the statement i = 0. Also, we need a variable for the result that will be initialized
                    to 1 so add the statement result = 1. When coding loops, it&rsquo;s generally accepted and
                    understood the single letter variables i, j and k are loop counters. If you prefer to use a variable
                    name such as count, that&rsquo;s fine too. Draw a line from the input to the process box.</p>
                <p>Next, add a decision diamond to test the loop condition. Since we initialized i = 0, we need to ask
                    the question is i &lt; exponent. Draw a flow line into the top of the decision diamond. The
                    flowchart will now look like this:</p>
                <p><img src="/courses/49289/file_contents/course%20files/course_image/lab03/decision.png"
                        alt="decisions" /></p>
                <p>fig.9 Start &gt; Input &gt; Initialize &gt; Conditional</p>
                <p>In a decision diamond, there will always be 2 flow lines coming out; one for the true path and 1 for
                    the false path. For a loop, when the loop condition is false, the loop will terminate. We&rsquo;ll
                    arbitrarily start with the true path so we need to add a process box to set result = result * number
                    and, very important, increment the loop counter by 1. Again, to save time and space, we&rsquo;ll put
                    both in the same box. Draw a flow line from the right side of the decision diamond to the process
                    box. Double-click the flow line and label true. It&rsquo;s also generally accepted to use Yes/No,
                    T/F or Y/N Instead of True/False. Add a flow line from the process box to the top of the decision
                    diamond. Our flowchart should now look something like this:</p>
                <p><img src="/courses/49289/file_contents/course%20files/course_image/lab03/loop.png" alt="loop" /></p>
                <p>fig.10 Loop structure</p>
                <p>When the loop condition is false, the loop will terminate and the next step will be to add another
                    data (input/output) parallelogram to display the result. Add a flowline labeled false from the
                    bottom of the decision diamond to our output step. Last, add a terminator and a flowline from the
                    output. Our finished flowchart will look like this:</p>
                <p><img src="/courses/49289/file_contents/course%20files/course_image/lab03/flow-exponent.png"
                        alt="example flowchart for exponent" /></p>
                <p>fig.11 Exponent - Flowchart</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <ul>Things to notice about a &ldquo;properly drawn&rdquo; flowchart:
                    <li>Distinct start/end points.</li>
                    <li>Flowlines run from top to bottom, left to right with the exception of flow lines going to the
                        top of a loop.</li>
                    <li>Flowlines in a decision are clearly labeled with the true and false path.</li>
                    <li>Arrows on flow lines point to the next step in the process.</li>
                    <li>Each program structure has exactly one entry and one exit point; no steps lead to a dead end.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Last thing: Be sure to save your work! If you plan to edit or do work on your flowchart later on, be
                    sure to click on File and then &ldquo;Save as&rdquo;</p>
                <p><img src="/courses/49289/file_contents/course%20files/course_image/lab03/save_as.png"

                <p>Enter a suitable file name. If you want to save to your computer, select &ldquo;Device&rdquo;. You
                    may also save to one of the online cloud based accounts shown below assuming you have a user
                    account. By default, Draw.io saves to the Windows user downloads directory. Be sure to copy or move
                    the file to your lab folder.</p>
                <p class="ic-flash-info"><strong>Do not submit this Draw.io (XML) file!</strong> Keep reading.</p>

                <p>fig.13 Export as JPEG</p>
                <p>For comparison purposes, we could write pseudocode something like this:</p>
                <pre>Get number
Get exponent
i = 0
result = 1

while i &lt; exponent
    result = result * number
    i = i + 1
end while

Display result
</pre>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3>Factorial</h3>
                <p>For the factorial exercise, recall from a math class somewhere along the way that the expression 5!
                    is simply a short hand notation for 1*2*3*4*5 Once again, does this look like something we could
                    code using a loop?</p>
                <p>Refer to the previous exercise if you need details on how to create a flowchart, add shapes, draw
                    flow lines, etc. The factorial flowchart should look something like this:</p>
                <p><img src="/courses/49289/file_contents/course%20files/course_image/lab03/flow-factorial.png"
                        alt="example flowchart for factorial" /></p>
                <p>fig.14 Flowchart example: Factorial</p>
                <p>For both exercises, notice how we initialized our result variable to 1 because multiplying by 0 will
                    give a result of 0. Be aware! Little things like this are very common logical errors in programming!
                </p>

            <h3>Investment Growth</h3>
            <p>Create a Python application that will allow the user to calculate the future value of an investment. The
                user will enter a monthly amount, annual interest rate and number of years for the investment.</p>
            <p>You will code a loop to calculate the future value and display the value of each month and then display
                the final value.</p>
            <p>Some key formulas and free Python code snippets:</p>
            <p>Note that the term is in years but we need to show the value of each month. So a 5 year savings account
                would be 60 months.</p>
            <p><code>months = years * 12</code></p>
            <p>Interest rates are a percentage and entered as 3.25 (i.e., for 3.25%), 1.125, etc. This is also an annual
                percentage rate (APR). We need to divide this rate by 100 and then by 12 to get the monthly percentage
                rate.</p>
            <p><code>monthlyIntRate = annualIntRate / 100 /12</code></p>
            <p>The futureValue variable is an accumulator as it accumulates value as the loop executes.</p>
            <p><code>futureValue = (futureValue + monthlyAmount) * (1 + monthlyRate)</code></p>

                        to:<br /><code>"month: {0:3d} FV: ${1:.2f} Interest ${2:.2f}"</code><br />note those are
                        <em>curly braces</em> "{}", not parentheses "()"
                    </p>
                    <p>Specifically this string as used for the <code>.format()</code> command used below.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Test your application using the following values:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Monthly Amount = 100</li>
                        <li>Interest Rate = 6</li>
                        <li>Years = 5</li>
                    </ul>
                    Your result should be somewhere around $7011.88. Results should be reasonably close (+/- 2%).
                    Don&rsquo;t worry if your results have a large number of decimal places. Number formatting is
                    optional for this exercise.
                </li>
                <li>Calculate and display the total interest earned. After the loop, add a line to display the total
                    interest earned.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Heads or Tails!</h3>
            <p>In this exercise, you will get some experience with the random number generator in Python. Random numbers
                are heavily used in many games and simulations for things like dice rolls, dealing cards, flipping a
                coin, etc.</p>
            <p>You will build an application that will flip a coin 20 times, keep a running total of heads and tails.
            </p>
            <p>For each coin toss, display the result (heads or tails).</p>
            <p>After the last toss, you will display</p>
            <ul>
                <li>total number of heads</li>
                <li>total number of tails</li>
                <li>and the percentage of each</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>

                <li>Create a new Python file called <code>HeadsTails.py</code></li>
                <li>Code the application. Be sure to import random. A screen shot of a partially coded application is
                    given here to get you started:<br />
                    The header was incorrect also so that is blurred out for you to replace too.<br />
