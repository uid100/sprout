            <p data-sourcepos="1:1-1:83">One-dimensional arrays (or 1D arrays) are a fundamental data structure in Java
                programming. They are used to store a collection of elements of the same type in a contiguous memory
                location. This makes it efficient to access elements of the array, as they can be accessed using their
                index.</p>
            <p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:210">1D arrays are used in a wide variety of Java applications. For example, they
                can be used to store the scores of students in a class, the names of employees in a company, or the
                coordinates of points on a graph.</p>
            <p data-sourcepos="7:1-7:76">Here are some of the benefits of working with 1D arrays in Java programming:
            </p>
            <ul data-sourcepos="9:1-13:0">
                <li data-sourcepos="9:1-9:186"><strong>Efficient access to elements:</strong> As mentioned earlier, 1D
                    arrays can be accessed efficiently using their index. This makes them ideal for storing and
                    retrieving large amounts of data.</li>
                <li data-sourcepos="10:1-10:136"><strong>Easy to implement:</strong> 1D arrays are relatively easy to
                    implement in Java. They can be declared and initialized using a simple syntax.</li>
                <li data-sourcepos="11:1-11:138"><strong>Flexible:</strong> 1D arrays can be used to store a variety of
                    data types, including primitives (such as int, float, and String) and objects.</li>
                <li data-sourcepos="12:1-13:0"><strong>Robust:</strong> 1D arrays are a robust data structure. They are
                    not prone to errors, such as null pointer exceptions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p data-sourcepos="14:1-14:331">Overall, 1D arrays are a powerful and versatile data structure that can be
                used to solve a wide variety of problems in Java programming. If you are new to Java, I highly recommend
                learning about 1D arrays. They are a fundamental building block of Java programming and will be used in
                many of the applications that you will develop.</p>
            <p data-sourcepos="16:1-16:218">In addition to the benefits mentioned above, 1D arrays are also used to
                implement other data structures, such as stacks, queues, and linked lists. This makes them even more
                important for Java programmers to understand.</p>
            <p data-sourcepos="1:1-1:83">The goal of this assignment is for you to set up Java and Eclipse on your
                computer. You will learn to get starter code from GitHub and practice running them in Eclipse. Finally,
                you will review a little bit of programing concepts such as iteration, methods and arrays.</p>

        <p>Module 1 programming assignment is set up as a JUnit assignment consisting of the challenge class called
            <strong>M1Challenge.java</strong> and the test class called <strong>TestM1Challenge.java. </strong>This
            simplistic setup is all you need to get started for this programming assignment. You will be reminded of the
            use of these two files repeatedly throughout this document.
        </p>
        <h3>M1Challenge</h3>
        <p>This is where you will be implementing the code. In this assignment, you will be completing a couple of
            methods and writing some from scratch.</p>
        <h3>TestM1Challenge</h3>
        <p>This is a set of code that has been provided for you. The code is broken up into a series of test methods
            that you will uncomment as you implement them in <strong>M1Challenge.java</strong></p>

                        <div class="panel-body">Let's take a look at the add method together in<strong> M1Challenge.java
                            </strong>as shown below. The first thing you will notice is the comment above the add method
                            which provides <strong>Javadoc</strong> style information. Javadoc is a built-in
                            documentation generator that you can use in Java. If you type (above the method)
                            <strong>/**</strong> then press enter, it will autogenerate the stub for you. You can delete
                            the entire comment stub above the add method if you want to try this now on your own!
                            <i>Side note: Sometimes parameter names might slightly differ, but they will represent the
                                same thing in your code setup.</i><br /><br />

                        Now let's take a look at the corresponding test method under
                        <strong>TestM1Challenge.java</strong> as shown below. The test method has two assertions that
                        run and evaluates if the two expressions are equal otherwise an <strong>AssertionError</strong>
                        is thrown. <br /><br />AssertEquals(4, add(2, 2)): This checks if the return of add(2, 2) is
                        equal to 4.<br />AssertEquals(0, add(2, -2)): This checks if the return of add(2, -2) is equal
                        to 0.<br /><br />

                        Your workflow to complete this first programming challenge will involve editing both files as
                        explained in more detail below.
                    </div>
                    <div class="panel-body"><br />The first method, add, has been done for you! Let's complete one of
                        the methods together so you can get familiar with a potential workflow for completing a
                        programming challenge. Your workflow will change halfway through this programming challenge
                        because you will go from completing provided methods to writing the full methods.
                        <br /><br />Workflow for the first half of the programming challenge:<br />1: Implement the
                        method<br />2: Uncomment and run the test method<br /><br /><strong>multiply</strong>:<br />The
                        method multiply will return the product of the parameters a and b. You will find that there is a
                        random -11111 return provided in the method which is incorrect. This is provided so that the
                        compiler is happy and you are able to run the code without having to complete all of the methods
                        yet. Finish the method and run the project. It will run the test class by default. <br />
                        <pre>/**<br /> * Purpose: multiply two numbers<br /> * @param a one number<br /> * @param b another number<br /> * @return the product of a and b<br /> */<br />public static int multiply(int a, int b)<br />{<br />	// TODO: change this to make the tests pass<br />	<span style="background-color: #ffff00; color: #000000;">return -11111; //Should be return a * b</span><br />}</pre>
                        <br /><strong>getFirst</strong>:<br />This method has a single parameter named array. Access and
                        return the first element. You will see that the tester for this method is commented out in
                        <strong>TestM1Challenge.java.</strong> Take the time now to uncomment it then run the code. You
                        will notice some very simplistic test cases have been written for this method. Some small arrays
                        have been created and initialized which are then utilized in the assertions.<br /><br />
                        <pre>/**<br /> * Purpose: return the first element in the given array<br /> * <br /> * @param array to search<br /> * @return first element<br /> */<br />public static int getFirst(int[] array)<br />{<br />	// TODO: change this method to make the tests pass<br />	return -77777; <span style="background-color: #ffff00; color: #000000;">// should be array[0]</span><br />}</pre>
                        <br /><strong>getLast, getMiddle</strong>: <br />The process to complete these next two methods
                        are similar to getFirst. Complete the method as described in the comment. You are accessing a
                        specific location in the array, but be sure not to hardcode a specific number. It should be
                        calculated based on the length of the given array.
                    </div>
                    <div class="panel-body">Workflow for the 2nd half of the programming challenge:<br />1: Look at the
                        test method in TestM1Challenge.java and figure out what the method is that you are going to
                        implement. <br />2. Implement the method in
                        M1Challenge.java<br /><strong><br />max</strong>:<br />1: Let's look at the provided test method
                        together. You will see numerous assertions, a.k.a. multiple tests, for this method. Each test
                        uses an array which is then passed to the max method. If you have not guessed already, this
                        method will find the maximum element in the array and return that element (its value, not
                        position). This method, however, has not been written in
                        <strong>M1Challenge</strong>.<strong>java</strong> and thus will result in a compile error. You
                        cannot call a method that does not exist! <br />
                        <pre>@Test<br />void testMax()<br />{<br />	int[] array1 = { 1 };<br />	// This checks that max returns 1 (the only element)<br />	assertEquals(1, max(array1));<br />	<br />	array1[0] = -2147483648;<br />	assertEquals(-2147483648, max(array1));<br /><br />	int[] array2 = { 1, 2, 2147483647 };<br />	// This checks that max returns 2147483647, the largest element<br />	assertEquals(2147483647, max(array2));<br /><br />	int[] array3 = { -1, 2, -2147483648 };<br />	// This checks that max returns 2, which is the largest element<br />	assertEquals(2, max(array3));<br /><br />	int[] array4 = { -42, -2, -3 };<br />	// This checks that max returns -2, which is the largest element<br />	assertEquals(-2, max(array4));<br />	<br />	int[] array5 = { 3, 1, 2 };<br />	assertEquals(3, max(array5));<br />			<br />	int[] array6 = { 2, 1, 3 };<br />	assertEquals(3, max(array6));<br />	<br />	int[] array7 = { 2, 3, 1 };<br />	assertEquals(3, max(array7));<br />}</pre>
                        2: Based on how the method should work, let's write the method header together for this one. The
                        template for writing a method has been provided for you at the bottom of M1Challenge.java. You
                        can copy-paste this block of code and fill in the parts. For the code below, I replaced the
                        question marks with what each part represents for a Java method in case you need some hints!
                        Let's do it together now. <br /><br />
                        <pre>// Use this template for the other methods<br />/**<br /> * Purpose:<br /> * <br /> * @param array<br /> * @return<br /> */<br />//public static {return type} {method name}({parameter type}[] array)<br />//{<br />//	return ???;<br />//}</pre>
                        <p>{return type}: The return type of a method is the type of method being returned when the
                            method is done executing. For example, it might return double, int, or boolean. If a method
                            does not return data, it is void. For this max method, since it returns an element from an
                            int array we know that it is returning an int.<br />{method name}: Methods should be
                            lowercase. For this one, the tester method gives us a hint that we should name the method
                            <strong>max</strong>.<br />{parameter type}: This can be a primitive type like int, double,
                            boolean or arrays, Strings, or custom class types.
                        </p>
                        <p>For this max method problem, the final method header will be:</p>
                        <pre>public static int max(int[] array){<br />   <br />}</pre>
                        <p>Once you have added this in M1Challenge.java, you should see the compile error not go away
                            quite yet! That's because the method header expects the method to return a value and
                            currently is is not. To silence the compiler while you are debugging and thinking about your
                            logic, you can add some dummy return line similar to what was done with the first few
                            methods. Add<strong> return -1</strong> inside the method to make the compiler happy for
                            now.</p>
                        <pre>public static int max(int[] array){<br />   return -1; //dummy return to make compiler happy while you think about the code!<br />}</pre>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        Searching through an array will require you to use an array to visit each element in the array
                        known as a traversal. Below is a typical loop for array traversal.<br />
                        <pre>for(int i = 0; i &lt; array.length; i++){<br /><br />}</pre>
                        <p>Let's combine this with the fact that we are looking for the largest element in the array.
                            First, we can assume that the first element is the largest. As you walk the array, starting
                            at the second element, check if that element is larger and mark it as the largest. Alter the
                            for loop so that it can skip the first element since we will define that as our current
                            maximum value. Below is the complete body of the max method along with the comments. The
