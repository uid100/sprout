            <h2>Course Overview</h2>
            <p>In this course, you will learn how to solve problems in Java while increasing your Java programming
                skills
                through hands-on programming of apps and games. We will focus on working together to increase your
                proficiency for a set of Learning Objectives (LOs), advancing through 4 levels of mastery</p>

        <div id="fragment-LOs">
            <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
            <p>There are 10 Learning Outcomes (LOs) for this course. When you successfully complete this course
                you will be able to...</p>
            <ol style="margin-left:30px">
                <li>Employ design principles of Object Oriented Programming</li>
                <li>Construct programs using single and multidimensional arrays</li>
                <li>Construct programs using objects and classes</li>
                <li>Construct programs using inheritance and polymorphism, including abstract classes and interfaces
                </li>
                <li>Construct programs using exception handling</li>
                <li>Construct programs using text file Input/Output</li>
                <li>Construct programs using graphical user interfaces utilizing event-driven programming</li>
                <li>Construct programs using generic collections and data structures</li>
                <li>Construct programs using recursion</li>
                <li>Construct programs using multiple threads</li>
            </ol>
            <p>There are four levels of proficiency for each LO. In the diagram below, you can see how each level of
                proficiency leads to the next, and what you need to demonstrate to reach the next level. Most modules
                will guide you through the first two levels for a single LO, with multiple activities for practice at
                each level. You can use these activities to improve and to demonstrate your proficiency before moving
                on to the next level. During the class, there will be a project where you will have an opportunity to
                demonstrate mastery.</p>
            <p>Some of the LOs were covered briefly in CISC 190, but you may have decided to dive in deeper and
                therefore you are already at a higher level of proficiency for a particular LO. That&rsquo;s okay
                - you can choose which activities you will complete to demonstrate proficiency - you can skip the
                early levels and jump right in at the Middle Developer level if you want!</p>

            <h2>Common Student Questions</h2>
            <h3>How does this class work?</h3>
            <p>The class is designed to provide you with multiple learning opportunities, including discussing the
                material with your classmates and practicing applying what you&rsquo;ve learned to fun problems.</p>
            <p>To succeed in this class, I recommend that you complete the reading and attempt the Level 1
                activities early in the week(s) assigned to the module. Actively engage in discussion and code-writing
                activities. Work with your classmates to help improve both your proficiency and theirs! When you
                are ready, create and submit an explanation video to demonstrate understanding and Level 3 proficiency.
                A class project provides an opportunity to demonstrate Level 4 mastery.</p>
            <p>Plan to work a little each day, and to spend 6-10 hours outside of class time each week working on this
                course.</p>
            <h3>How do you assign letter grades for the class?</h3>
            <p>For each LO, there are a variety of activities to demonstrate proficiency levels. Each activity is
                aligned with a particular level, and is graded on a Satisfactory/Not Yet basis with feedback provided
                (Canvas will display as complete/incomplete). Successful completion of activities for a particular
                proficiency level mean that you have achieved that level for the LO.</p>

            <h3>When are assignments due?</h3>
            <p>Each activity in a module has a due date to help keep you on track; I expect that you will submit a
                reasonable attempt on time, even if it is not yet complete. If you have not successfully demonstrated
                Junior
                Developer (Level 2) proficiency or higher for a LO by the last due date of the Module in which it is
                covered, that is a sign you may need extra help. To ensure your success in the course, I will ask you to
                attend office hours and/or tutoring until you are caught up.</p>
            <p>Modules are released as the course progresses so that we move through the class material as a cohort.
                But,
                everyone learns at a different pace. Work for <i>any </i>assignment will be accepted for full credit
                through
                <i>Friday, May 24.</i>
            </p>
            <p>Campus administrative deadlines that you should know:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><i>Friday, February 9 (Add/Drop Deadline). Successfully complete through the end of Module 1 or you
                        may be dropped from the course.</i> In my experience with students in previous terms, you are
                    not
                    likely to successfully complete the course if you haven&rsquo;t gotten started by the add/drop
                    deadline.
                </li>
                <li><i>Friday April 12 (Withdraw Deadline). Demonstrate a reasonable attempt for at least Junior
                        Developer Level on Modules 1-5 or you may be withdrawn from the course.</i> In my experience
                    with students in previous terms, you are not likely to successfully complete the course if you
                    have not been able to keep up.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Can I improve my grade on an assignment?</h3>
            <p>Yes! If you do not successfully complete an assignment, you should rework it and resubmit when it is
                improved. You may want to review the activities at one level lower than the activity you&rsquo;re
                working on to ensure that you learned everything you could at that level. Resubmitted work can only
                improve your grade, never lower it.</p>
            <h3>What is the collaboration policy?</h3>
            <p>Learning is a community activity. I encourage you to work with classmates and form virtual study groups
                to support your learning. Use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming">pair
                    programming</a>,
                especially at the Junior Developer level. Pairs are also encouraged for projects. You are responsible
                for your own learning; when collaborating with classmates, if you don&rsquo;t understand something, make
                sure to ask! Videos for Middle and Senior Developer levels must be created independently by each student
                (e.g. don&rsquo;t share a script with your partner), but will frequently reference the same code (that
                you
                worked together to write).</p>
            <p>All submitted code must have the names of all people who helped you with the code (regardless of whether
                the person assisting you is enrolled in this course). Additionally, if you borrowed source code, or
                gained
                inspiration from, an online source, that source must be clearly cited in the code comments.</p>
            <h3>What skills am I learning in this course?</h3>
            <p>In addition to learning Java programming, you will also have the opportunity to practice and refine
                Employable Skills that are in demand by employers. Did you know that employers are often less concerned
                about what programming languages you know (these skills are easy to learn on the job), and are more
                concerned about collaboration and communication skills? Here is a list of some of the skills that you
                will be able to put on your resume: critical thinking, problem solving, analytical skills,
                teamwork/collaboration, troubleshooting, research, planning, creativity, resilience/perseverance,
                written communication, lifelong learning.</p>

            </p>
            <h3><strong>Student Code of Conduct:</strong></h3>
            <p>Students are expected to adhere to the Student Code of Conduct at all times. Students who violate the
                Student
                Code of Conduct may be removed from class by the faculty for the class meeting in which the behavior
                occurred, and the next class meeting. This included, at a minimum, behaving respectfully toward other
                students and the instructor, both in the classroom and online.</p>
            <p>Students will receive a 0 for any work missed during a removal period. Additional work, including written
                or
                verbal apologies or reflective essays may be required before returning to class.</p>
            <p>Incidents involving removal of a student from class will be reported to the college disciplinary officer
                for
                follow up.</p>
            <p>The Student Code of Conduct can be found in Board of Trustees Policy, BP 3100, Student Rights,
                Responsibilities and Administrative Due Process posted on the District website at: <a

            <h3><strong>San Diego Mesa College Academic Honesty Statement:</strong></h3>
            <p>San Diego Mesa College values honesty, academic integrity, and community. Our goal is to guide our
                students
                in maintaining academic excellence, in addition to fostering a sense of belonging to our campus. At San
                Diego Mesa College, students are expected to create their own work in connection with all lecture and
                laboratory assessments and assignments, and will refrain from copying, cheating, plagiarizing, utilizing
                outside resources, or any form of academic misconduct. Students will only use external sources when
                approved
                by faculty and will properly acknowledge these external sources. We understand our students wish to
                maintain
                these community standards; however, failure to follow these community standards will be considered a
                violation of the Student Code of Conduct under Board Policy 3100 and may result in student disciplinary
                action. We thank our students in advance for adhering to these community standards.</p>
            <h3><strong>Accommodating Students with Disabilities:</strong></h3>
            <p>I have made every effort to make this course accessible to all students, including students with
                disabilities. If you encounter a problem accessing anything in this course, please contact me
                immediately.
            </p>
            <p>Students with disabilities who may need academic accommodations should discuss options with their
                professors
                during the first two weeks of class. All information will be kept confidential. A written notice of
                registration with DSPS is required for accommodations to be made.</p>
            <p>Students that need evacuation assistance during campus emergencies should also meet with the instructor
                as
                soon as possible to assure the health and safety of all students.</p>
            <p>For more information, you may contact the DSPS Office at Mesa or the website at <a
                    href="https://www.sdmesa.edu/student-services/disability-services/" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener">https://www.sdmesa.edu/student-services/disability-services/</a>.</p>
            <h3><strong>Maintaining Enrollment in the Class:</strong></h3>
            <p>It is the student&rsquo;s responsibility to drop all classes which he/she is no longer participating.</p>
            <p>It is the instructor&rsquo;s discretion to withdraw a student due to excessive absences or failure to
                demonstrate passing-level proficiency in the modules by the due dates.</p>
            <p>Students who remain enrolled in a class beyond the published withdrawal deadline, as stated in the class
                schedule, will receive an evaluative letter grade in this class.</p>
            <p>Failure to submit work in a timely fashion prior to the add/drop deadline will result in the instructor
                dropping the student. Space in the class will then be given to a student on the waitlist. After the
                add/drop
                deadline, the instructor is not responsible for dropping any student &ndash; it is the student&rsquo;s
                responsibility to drop if he/she is no longer attending. However, it is at the instructor&rsquo;s
                discretion
                to drop students who are no longer participating in the class at any time.</p>
            <h3><strong>Lactation</strong></h3>
            <p>In accordance with state law, students currently lactating are permitted, without academic penalty, to
                access
                campus lactation rooms when needed to express milk or breastfeed a child. An authorized accommodation to
                do
                so may be obtained by contacting the DSPS office. If a student expects that they may need such an
                accommodation, they should speak with relevant faculty members as soon as is possible to minimize
                disruption
                to their course.</p>
            <h3><strong>Accessible Educational Materials</strong></h3>
            <p>The district has a standard for access to electronic materials used in the classroom to comply with
                federal
                law. This includes accessible websites and any other electronic materials that students need to use to
                access services or a course.</p>
            <p>Audio or Video formatted information, such as DVD&rsquo;s, must have captioning</p>
            <p>Online software associated with a classroom book must meet the federal standards that allow information
                to be
                used with a screen reader for persons needing that accommodation. This might include persons that may be
                visually impaired or have learning disabilities. Additional information is available in AP 3108.1</p>
            <h3><strong>Notice</strong></h3>
            <p>The instructor reserves the right to change the contents of this syllabus as needed during the term. If
                the
                syllabus is changed, an updated copy will be posted on Canvas.</p>
