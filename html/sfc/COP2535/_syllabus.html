                <p>This course will focus on the design and analysis of data structures and the use of algorithms.
                    Through the introduction of the most widely used data structures employed in solving commonly
                    encountered problems, such as linked lists, binary trees, queues, and stacks, students will learn
                    different ways to organize data for easy access and efficient manipulation. Algorithms to solve
                    classic problems, such as searching, sorting, hashing, and graph algorithms will also be presented.
                    This course assumes the student has a basic understanding of object-oriented programming in the C++
                    programming language.</p>
                <ul>Topics covered include:
                    <li>Abstract Data Types (ADTs)</li>
                    <li>Sort and Search algorithms</li>

                            <dd>✓ In COP 2535, you are going to be discussing and developing object-orienged solutions
                                for classical data handling algorithms using the C++ programming language. You will use
                                the textbook as well as other online resources.<br />Microsoft provides a Community
                                Edition of Visual Studio (2022) available for Windows 10 and 11.<br />- The Visual
                                Studio set-up program installs the most current version of .NET Core, as well as SQL
                                Server 2016 Express LocalDB. You must use the Visual Studio IDE as that is the program
                                your instructor will use to grade your homework submissions.<br />- Microsoft Visual
                                Studio for Mac is supported only as a .NET language compatible environment, Visual
                                Studio Code (not the same product) does support C++, and may be an acceptable, but not
                                recommended solution.<br />- It is highly recommended that students use a Windows
                                computer for this course. There are systems available for use in the student lab.</dd>
                            <dd>✓ We recommend a USB headset with microphone (especially for online classes).</dd>
                            <dd>✓ Video camera. The video camera on a cell phone or laptop will be sufficient for this
                                course.</dd>

            <dd>I will be using the Canvas Course Management system for class activities. In addition to participating
                in online discussions, taking exams online and submitting labs online, I may provide various learning
                resources such as PowerPoint slides for each chapter, lecture/chapter notes, videos and code samples as
                needed to help you get through the chapter material. You are welcome and encouraged to use these
                learning resources in addition to the text material. Please feel free to ask if there's a particular
                code sample or a demonstration video that you need that isn't already available. I'm here to help you
                succeed.</dd>
            <dd>I will periodically (usually weekly) post announcements to the Class Announcements page and/or send out
                e-mails to class members that may include things such as class announcements, assignment due dates, exam
                reminders, and answers to frequently asked questions. To ensure that you are "kept in the loop", please
                make sure your e-mail address in Canvas is an e-mail account you check on a regular basis.</dd>
            <dd>Lab exercises and projects are intended to help reinforce the various program design and coding concepts
                being taught in the class. I will try to make the assignments "within reason" such that they can be
                completed within the allotted time but this may vary depending on the material and your prior
                experience. Due dates for each lab are posted in Canvas with the lab a ssignment. Please check the due
                date carefully and recheck periodically as I may adjust due dates depending on the needs of the class.

            <dd>I am available to assist you with questions and problems with assignments as needed. If you have

                discussion forums on Canvas where you can post questions. I am also available through Zoom for live

                <p>Plagiarism hurts your personal &amp; professional reputation, the personal &amp; professional
                    reputation of others, and the reputation of the college. Unless specified otherwise, all assignments

                    industry, where most projects are done in a team environment, team members are expected to
                    contribute substantial original effort to their assigned portion(s) of a project. Information

                        work and thinking for you. Plagiarism will not help get you ahead in future classes that build
                        upon this one nor will it help you get ahead in the workplace! </strong></p>

                    plagiarism matters. If you use the campus lab computers, make sure you take your personal storage
                    media with you when you leave and don't leave hard copy source code/documentation lying around the
