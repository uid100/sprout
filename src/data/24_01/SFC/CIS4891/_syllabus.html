            <dd>I will be using the Canvas Course Management system for class activities. In addition to participating
                in online discussions, taking exams online and submitting labs online, I may provide various learning
                resources such as PowerPoint slides for each chapter, lecture/chapter notes, videos and code samples as
                needed to help you get through the chapter material. You are welcome and encouraged to use these
                learning resources in addition to the text material. Please feel free to ask if there's a particular
                code sample or a demonstration video that you need that isn't already available. I'm here to help you
                succeed.</dd>
            <dd>I will periodically post announcements to the Class Announcements page and/or send out e-mails to class
                members that may include things such as class announcements, assignment due dates, exam reminders, and
                answers to frequently asked questions. To ensure that you are "kept in the loop", please make sure your
                e-mail address in Canvas is an e-mail account you check on a regular basis.</dd>
            <dd>Lab exercises and projects are intended to help reinforce the various program design and coding concepts
                being taught in the class. I will try to make the assignments "within reason" such that they can be
                completed within the allotted time but this may vary depending on the material and your prior
                experience. Due dates for each lab are posted in Canvas with the lab a ssignment. Please check the due
                date carefully and recheck periodically as I may adjust due dates depending on the needs of the class.

            <dd>I am available to assist you with questions and problems with assignments as needed. If you have

                discussion forums on Canvas where you can post questions. I am also available through Zoom for live

                <p>Plagiarism hurts your personal &amp; professional reputation, the personal &amp; professional
                    reputation of others, and the reputation of the college. Unless specified otherwise, all assignments
                    in this class are to be completed and turned in on an individual basis. Even in the software
                    industry, where most projects are done in a team environment, team members are expected to
                    contribute substantial original effort to their assigned portion(s) of a project. Information

                        work and thinking for you. Plagiarism will not help get you ahead in future classes that build
                        upon this one nor will it help you get ahead in the workplace! </strong></p>

                    code, documentation, etc.) will result in a zero score for all parties involved. Repeated offenses
                    may result in referral for disciplinary action pursuant to the College guidelines for discipline in
                    plagiarism matters. If you use the campus lab computers, make sure you take your personal storage
                    media with you when you leave and don't leave hard copy source code/documentation lying around the
