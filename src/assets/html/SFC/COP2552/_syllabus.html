            <dd>I will be using the Canvas Course Management system for class activities. In addition to participating
                in online discussions, taking exams online and submitting labs online, I may provide various learning
                resources such as PowerPoint slides for each chapter, lecture/chapter notes, videos and code samples as
                needed to help you get through the chapter material. You are welcome and encouraged to use these
                learning resources in addition to the text material. Please feel free to ask if there's a particular
                code sample or a demonstration video that you need that isn't already available. I'm here to help you
                succeed.</dd>
            <dd>I will periodically (usually weekly) post announcements to the Class Announcements page and/or send out
                e-mails to class members that may include things such as class announcements, assignment due dates, exam
                reminders, and answers to frequently asked questions. To ensure that you are "kept in the loop", please
                make sure your e-mail address in Canvas is an e-mail account you check on a regular basis.</dd>
            <dd>Lab exercises and projects are intended to help reinforce the various program design and coding concepts
                being taught in the class. I will try to make the assignments "within reason" such that they can be
                completed within the allotted time but this may vary depending on the material and your prior
                experience. Due dates for each lab are posted in Canvas with the lab a ssignment. Please check the due
                date carefully and recheck periodically as I may adjust due dates depending on the needs of the class.
